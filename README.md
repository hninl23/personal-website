This is a personal project website to experiment with REACT/Vite while showcasing my experiences and past projects.


## Things I learned 🤔:

- Using '###.module.css' for the styling to NOT override each other
- How to add simple animation using @keyframe
- Using specific width and heigh to make the website responsive
- Using Figma to read designs and translate them into REACT
